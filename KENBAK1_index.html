        <p>This small device, made in 1970s California, does not look like the computers that we know today. It does not have a screen for display, so you must get the hang of it switches and lights to operate it.</p>

        <p>Designed and produced in California, in 1970, by John Blankenbaker of Kenback Cooperation. Only 40 were ever built, designed as educational tools and offered for sale in Computerworld and Scientific American for $750 in 1971. Kenbak-1 offered 256 bytes of memory, a variety of operations and a speed equivalent to nearly 1 MHz This 6kg computer did not have a screen, keyboard or mouse, instead hosting a series of switches for input and lights for output.</p>
