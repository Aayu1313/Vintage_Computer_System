    <p> Vintage computers are like old-school toys of the tech world. They're computers people used a long time ago—before laptops and tablets! Imagine a computer that's super boxy, with tiny screens and big, clunky keyboards. Back then, computers could only do simple things like showing text or playing very basic games with stick-like characters.</p>

    
    <p>Think of them like time machines—they give us a peek into what life was like when your parents or grandparents were kids! People who love vintage computers enjoy fixing them and playing the games from those days. It's a fun way to learn about history and see how far we've come with technology!</p>
