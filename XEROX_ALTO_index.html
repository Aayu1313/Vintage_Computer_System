            <p>A very important piece of tech history, this computer is the reason we have desktop computers today; the Xerox Alto came out in 1973 with a monitor, a keyboard and mouse, which is much more familiar to us and what we know of computers today. Only a few thousand of these were actually made, being donated to research labs and universities.

            <p>Considered the Stonehenge of PC design, the Xerox Alto defined the computers that we know and use today. Built as an experimental machine in Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC), early 1070s California to explore new thinking and ideas in interface and design a few thousand were made and donated to research facilities and universities before the commercial version Xerox Star was sold in 1981. These machines hosted a portrait monitor (as opposed to the more widely used landscape monitors that we use in the present day), a keyboard and a networked workstation; Alto computers could be linked via a network and exchange communications</p>
