        <p>In 1981, IBM introduced the IBM PC (Model 5150), a machine that would change the world of computing forever.At the time, personal computers were still new, and different companies made machines that were not compatible with one another.IBM PC set a standard that helped shape modern computers and made technology more accessible to businesses and everyday users alike.</p>
        <p>One of the most important things about the IBM PC was its open architecture. Unlike other computers, IBM allowed companies to clone its design and create “PC-compatible” computers. This decision meant that instead of having many different types of computers that could not communicate, people could buy machines that all worked with the same software and hardware. It was the start of what we now call the PC industry, allowing computers to evolve quickly and become widespread.</p>
        <p>The IBM PC ran on MS-DOS, an operating system developed by Microsoft. While MS-DOS might seem simple compared to modern Windows systems, it gave users the ability to run programs, manage files, and perform basic computing tasks. Many businesses relied on MS-DOS to run important applications, and its success helped make Microsoft one of the biggest technology companies in the world.</p>
        <p>Storage was an important part of the IBM PC design. It came with a floppy disk drive, which allowed users to load programs and save files on portable disks.Some models even had an optional hard drive, which made storing large amounts of data easier something that became essential as computers started handling more complex tasks.</p>
        <p>The IBM PC was not just for businesses, it helped bring personal computing into homes as well. People used it for writing documents, storing information, learning how to code, and even playing games.Its impact was huge, leading to the rise of “PC-compatible” computers that would dominate the market for decades.</p>
        <p> Today, every modern computer owes something to the IBM PC 5150. It laid the foundation for the computers we use today, showing the world that a personal computer could be powerful, useful, and available to everyone.</p>
