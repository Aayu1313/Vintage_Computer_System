        <p>What is viewed as the first ever computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer or ENIAC, was built to make wartime calculations for the US army in 1945.This computer was room-sized, but the ENIAC power can now fit into a coin-sized chip.</p>
        
        <p>In 1942 the product of physicist John Mauchly proposal for an all-electronic calculating machine, and the US Army need for faster wartime calculations, resulted in the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). Built between 1943 and 1945, this machine is considered the first large-scale computer to run at such a speed without being limited by any mechanical parts. For a whole decade, the ENIAC had done more calculations than all mankind had done up until that point. Frances Bilas and Betty Jean Jennings, both holding degrees in mathematics, aided in operating the ENIAC as programmers. The computer was room-sized, though now reimplemented into chip format using integrated circuit technology.</p>
